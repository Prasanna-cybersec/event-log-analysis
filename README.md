# Windows Event Log Analysis – Beginner SOC Analyst Project

## Project Summary
This is a self-initiated project simulating suspicious activities on a Windows machine, and analyzing them using the built-in Event Viewer — just like a SOC Analyst (L1) would. The goal is to show practical log analysis, reporting, and security documentation skills.

## Tools Used
- Windows Event Viewer
- PowerShell and CMD
- Task Manager
- Notepad (for report writing)
- GitHub

## What I Did
- Simulated suspicious activities:
  - Opened PowerShell and CMD
  - Terminated a process using Task Manager
- Viewed generated logs via Event Viewer
- Wrote 2 incident reports based on real events
